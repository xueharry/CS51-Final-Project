# Bayes classifer 
# Formula: p(h|D) = arg max [p(D|h) * p(h)]

# Implementation
class Classifier 

# Read in data and determine count 

# Calculate p(h)

# Calculate conditional probablity p(D|h)

# Returns the class we think the item vector is in
def classify

	# arg max of [p(D|h) * p(h)]
	max (results)
